- 👋 Hi, I’m @FJo69
- 👀 I’m interested in webbased software development, dabaseses (sql) and renewable energy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GIT and doing some steps in programming with JavaScript to work with Vue.js and CoreUI. I am firm with PLC technologies (S7, WAGO), PHP and C/Cpp, but my favorite is database technology with Oracle and PostgreSQL.
